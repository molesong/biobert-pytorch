375	In conclusion, the present data suggest that in a German Caucasian population the +62G-->A polymorphism of the @GENE$ gene is associated with @DISEASE$ but not with DM-2.
376	These findings suggest that @GENE$ may play a role in the @DISEASE$ of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance-related hypertension.
377	These results suggest that in men, the human @GENE$ gene is associated with reduced amount of @DISEASE$ and lower insulin secretory responses to a glucose load.

427	Variation of @GENE$-1beta may contribute to the @DISEASE$ of obesity, with a widespread Ala203 allele being a risk factor for the development of this common disorder.
428	The present study demonstrates that the @GENE$ genotype of the Gly482Ser polymorphism in the PPARGC1 gene might be a risk factor for @DISEASE$ in the Slovene population (Caucasians) with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.0-6.8), whereas the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma gene failed to confer susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy.
429	We conclude that  @GENE$ is likely to contribute to the risk of @DISEASE$ in offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes.
430	We conclude, that the Gly482Ser variant in @GENE$ is not associated with @DISEASE$-related traits or skeletal muscle fiber type composition in a non-diabetic German and Dutch population.

437	This study confirms the association of the Ala12 allele with reduced risk of @DISEASE$ in a @GENE$ 2 diabetic population and demonstrates that the T allele independently associates with an increased risk.
438	The genetic information about @GENE$ from this study would be useful for further genetic study of obesity, @DISEASE$, and other metabolic diseases.
439	@GENE$ could be directly involved in protecting critical enzymes or organelles against oxidative damage; PON2 may thus predispose to the development of microvascular @DISEASE$.

441	Thus, there is a significant association between the @GENE$-192R allele and coronary spasm; the PON1-192R allele may play an important role in the genesis of coronary spasm, probably by attenuating the @DISEASE$ of oxidative stress.
442	In contrast to traditional coronary risk factors, the @GENE$ M/L @DISEASE$ can be considered predictive of protection against CAD.

448	Our data suggest that @GENE$ Q192R polymorphism was not independently associated with MI but further increased the risk of MI among the subjects with DM, @DISEASE$, or both, the conditions associated with high oxidative stress.
449	This study suggests that the presence of the 192Arg-allele in the @GENE$ gene is a genetic risk factor for @DISEASE$ in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
450	Our observations suggest that this polymorphism could play a role in beta-@GENE$ @DISEASE$.
451	In conclusion, our data provided no evidence of a significant association between either @GENE$ promoter (-107)T>C or coding region, Q192R and L55M, polymorphisms and early @DISEASE$ in Sicilian hypercholesterolemic subjects.
452	Our data support the view that 192 R allele of @GENE$) gene is a risk factor for macrovascular @DISEASE$ of T2DM in Chinese.
453	In conclusion, @GENE$ status and HDL levels are independently associated with DM in patients on hemodialysis and may contribute to the increased risk of @DISEASE$ in diabetic nephropathy.

458	We propose that @GENE$ is among the likely susceptibility genes for @DISEASE$ and may also be involved in dyslipidemia.

470	Polymorphism on the @GENE$ binding region of hper2 gene which was previously reported, is unlikely to play an important role in the development of @DISEASE$.
471	We conclude that  the presence of CTG-->@GENE$ (Leu-->Val) substitution in codon 125 in CD31 is not associated with protection from severe @DISEASE$, and we suggest that selective forces other than malaria may maintain this high-frequency polymorphism.
472	Our results suggest that this allelic variation at the promoter region of the @GENE$ gene (alleles with three or four repeats), which may result in enhanced transcription of the gene, may contribute to relative protection and decrease individual vulnerability to develop @DISEASE$ or abuse.
473	The D76N variant of @GENE$ does not significantly alter insulin secretion or act as a high-risk susceptibility allele for late-onset type 2 diabetes as proposed previously, although we cannot exclude a @DISEASE$ role in increasing risk of diabetes.

517	Our findings suggest that genetic variability in the @GENE$ and neuropeptide Y genes is implicated in @DISEASE$ regulation, the LEPR Gln223Arg variant being associated with a BMI increase in this Caucasian population, especially in non-smokers, while the NPY Leu7Pro polymorphism was associated with BMI reduction in premenopausal women.

527	The present study found that the @GENE$ gene does not confer susceptibility to @DISEASE$ and schizoaffective disorders, at least in Japanese subjects, in contrast to the findings in British subjects.
528	Our results imply that @DISEASE$ caused by excess nitric oxide generated by @GENE$ contributes to Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer.
529	After evaluating for the first time the influence of @GENE$ promoter polymorphism in RA, it seems to have no major effect on @DISEASE$ susceptibility and/or outcome.
530	In the Asian Indian population, allele 210 bp of the @GENE$ gene is a high-risk allele for developing @DISEASE$ and alleles 200 and 220 bp protect an individual from developing retinopathy or its complications.
531	These findings offer no evidence for an allelic association of the tested @GENE$ polymorphism with the common forms of the @DISEASE$ and therefore do not support a role for this gene in migraine pathogenesis.
532	These results did not support any association of ecNOS and iNOS gene polymorphisms to the development of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ patients in a Japanese population.
