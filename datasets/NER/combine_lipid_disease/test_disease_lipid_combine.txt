Although O
the O

properties O

BRCA1 O

are O
not O
understood O
, O
their O
expression O

subcellular O

suggest O
a O

When O

, O
the O
steady O

levels O
of O
BRCA1 O
increase O
in O
late O

and O
reach O
a O
maximum O
during O

. O

Moreover O
, O
in O
S O

cells O
, O
BRCA1 O
polypeptides O
are O
hyperphosphorylated O
and O
accumulate O
into O
discrete O
subnuclear O

" O
BRCA1 O
associates O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O

of O
BARD1 O
, O
unlike O
those O
of O
BRCA1 O
, O
remain O
relatively O

during O

However O
, O
immunostaining O

that O
BARD1 O
resides O
within O
BRCA1 O
nuclear O

during O
S O
phase O
of O
the O
cell O

, O
but O
not O
during O
the O
G1 O

Nevertheless O
, O
BARD1 O

exclusively O
in O
the O
nuclear O
fractions O
of O
both O

Therefore O
