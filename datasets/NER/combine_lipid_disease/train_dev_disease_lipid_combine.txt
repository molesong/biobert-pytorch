Inherited O

were O
described O
recently O
in O

Familial B-disease

it O

not O
clear O
what O
proportion O

gastric B-disease

in O
non O

Maori O
populations O
is O
due O
to O
germline O
CDH1 O

. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
screened O
eight O
familial B-disease
gastric I-disease
cancer I-disease
kindreds O
of O
British O
and O
Irish O
origin O
for O
germline O
CDH1 O
mutations O
, O
by O
SSCP O
analysis O
of O
all O
16 O
exons O
and O

. O

Each O
family O
contained O
( O

) O
two O
cases O
of O
gastric B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
first O
degree O
relatives O
with O
one O
affected O
before O

; O
or O
( O
ii O
) O
three O

more O
cases O
of O
gastric B-disease

. O

Novel O
germline O
CDH1 O
mutations O
( O
a O
nonsense O
and O
a O

) O
were O
detected O
in O
two O
families O
( O
25 O

) O
. O

Both O
mutations O
were O
predicted O
to O
truncate O
the O
E O

in O
the O

. O

In O
one O
family O
there O
was O
evidence O
of O
non O

penetrance O
and O
susceptibility O
to O
both O
gastric B-disease

; O
thus O
, O
in O

to O
six O
cases O

, O
a O
CDH1 O

developed O

years O
. O

We O
have O
confirmed O
that O
germline O
mutations O
in O
the O
CDH1 O
gene O
cause O
familial B-disease
gastric I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
non O
- O
Maori O
populations O
. O

However O
, O
only O
a O
minority O
of O
familial O
gastric B-disease
cancers I-disease
can O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
CDH1 O
mutations O
. O

Loss O

has O
been O
implicated O

the O

, O
and O
our O
findings O
provide O
evidence O
that O
germline O
CDH1 O
mutations O
predispose O
to O
early O
onset O

Thus O
, O

should O
be O
investigated O

Before O

After O

, O
the O
three O

The O

CONCLUSIONS O
Lorenzos O

no O

Moreover O
, O
in O

this O

not O
modify O
significantly O
the O

However O
, O

RESULTS O
Three O

CONCLUSIONS O
There O

in O

Most O

harbour O

Recently O
, O
we O
discovered O
that O

are O
predisposed O
to O
developing O
skin B-disease

Given O
that O
the O
skin O
of O
these O
adult O
mice O
also O
exhibits O
signs O
of O
de O

, O
we O
wondered O
whether O
human O
pilomatricomas B-disease
might O
originate O
from O
hair O

cells O
and O
whether O
they O
might O
possess O

Here O
, O
we O
explore O
the O
cell O
origin O

aetiology O
of O
this O

We O
found O

the O

cells O
, O
providing O
biochemical O
evidence O
that O
pilomatricomas B-disease
are O
derived O
from O
hair O

cells O
. O

At O
least O
75 O
% O
of O
these O
tumours B-disease
possess O
mutations O
affecting O
the O
amino O

, O
normally O
involved O
in O

, O

This O
percentage O
of O

is O
greater O
than O
in O
all O
other O
human O
tumours B-disease
examined O
thus O

The O
Pendred B-disease

Pendred B-disease

characterized O

This O

Pendred B-disease

( O

was O
subsequently O
identified O
by O

PDS O

a O

Pendrin O

On O
the O

, O
pendrin O
has O
been O
proposed O
to O
function O
as O
a O
sulfate O

. O

We O
were O
unable O
to O
detect O
evidence O
of O

following O
the O

in O
Xenopus O

The O
rates O

were O
significantly O
increased O
following O
the O
expression O

pendrin O

Our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
pendrin O
functions O
as O
a O

indicate O
that O
this O

not O
due O

suggesting O
instead O
that O

alters O
the O

This O
conformationally O

The O
pathological O
form O

with O
an O

also O
associates O

These O

suggest O
that O
an O

may O

that O

we O
have O

Our O

demonstrate O
that O
the O

Thus O
, O

As O
ocular O

these O

that O

Although O
little O
is O
known O
regarding O
the O

in O
humans, O
nonanoic B-lipid

is O
a O
family O
of O
medium-chain O
fatty O

including O
valproic O

which O
is O
used O
to O
treat O
manic O

To O
determine O
whether O

activate O
small O

were O

In O
