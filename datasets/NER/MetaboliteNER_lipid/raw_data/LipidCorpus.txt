PMC2826632	D00023	Another study from the same group (Medina-Gomez ) identified a major decrease of TAG(48:2) in the POKO mouse (a double gene deletion of the leptin receptor and PPARγ) and a minor decrease in white adipose tissue (WAT) from ob/ob mice.

PMC3590212	A00005	Such effective mechanism might result in the activation of an anti-oxidative response, as displayed by decreased circulating levels of 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE, markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative products of linoleic acid.
PMC3590212	D00036	Centenarians displayed higher circulating levels of 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a major product of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) enzyme, known for its anti-inflammatory properties .
PMC3590212	D00037	Increased activation of cytochrome P450 pathway in centenarians is further supported by increased circulating levels of 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic (8,9-EpETrE) and decreased concentration of 11,12-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (11,12-DiHETrE).
PMC3590212	D00041	Therefore, the decreased concentration of 11,12-DiHETrE might reveal decreased sEH's effect on its precursor 11,12-EpETrE.

PMC3601443	A05008	More recent studies by Guo et al. reported that HETE0016, a selective inhibitor of CYP4A/F enzymes (, ) inhibited the formation of 20-HETE resulting in suppression of both 9L gliosarcoma and U251 glioma cell proliferation and tumor growth (, ).
PMC3601443	A05009	Similarly, the same group demonstrated that overexpression of the 20-HETE synthase CYP4A1 into U251 glioma cells resulted in hyperproliferation and more aggressive tumor growth.
PMC3601443	A05010	Additionally, inhibition of the synthesis and actions of 20-HETE with HET0016 and WIT002 (20-HETE antagonist) inhibits the proliferation of renal adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and the growth of kidney cancer tumors in an animal model in vivo .
PMC3601443	D00000	Recent development and characterization of selective and potent inhibitors of the CYP4A/F enzymes and antagonists of 20-HETE signaling (, , ), as well as the development of sensitive LC–MS/MS assays for the measurement of 20-HETE levels in biological samples, have suggested that 20-HETE plays a role in tumor growth and progression, at least in animal models.
PMC3601443	D00001	However, very little work has been done to determine whether expression of the enzymes that synthesize 20-HETE, as well as levels of 20-HETE are elevated in human cancer tumor samples.
PMC3601443	D00004	Furthermore, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and LC–MS/MS analysis showed that the expression of the CYP4F2 protein level and the production of 20-HETE was increased in human ovarian cancer samples.
PMC3601443	D00009	We further, additionally, demonstrated that the mechanism of signaling of 20-HETE in regulation of cell growth is via activation of the small-GTPase Ras in HRPTEC cells.
PMC3601443	D00010	20-HETE activation of small-GTPase Ras is consistent with previous findings by others that 20-HETE can act as a second messenger in the mitogenic actions of some growth factors and activate the ERK and PI3K-Akt cascades.
PMC3601443	D00011	To overcome the obstacle of the presence of mutated form of Ras in cancer cells, we have selected a normal human cell line, HRPTEC to study 20-HETE signaling by small-GTPase Ras.
PMC3601443	D00012	In the absence of authentication of the 20-HETE transmembrane receptors, the alternative that intracellular signaling molecules such as Ras serve as direct intracellular targets of 20-HETE molecules can’t be excluded.
PMC3601443	D00013	In summary, the results of previous studies have indicated that inhibitors of the synthesis of 20-HETE block the proliferation and growth of brain and renal tumors in animal models (, ).

PMC3726671	D00023	This would result from Δ7 or Δ9- and other trans -hexadecanoic acids being a substrate for the slightly promiscuous serine palmitoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.50) to form a 3-ketodehydrosphingosine, which would then be reduced and acylated by oleyl-CoA followed by desaturation to form Cer(d18:2/18:1).

PMC4012283	D00016	The finding that patients with FESZ have reduced concentrations of nonanoic acid suggests that abnormal inositol phosphate signaling may have a role in schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00040	Patients with FESZ had increased levels of creatine, and decreased levels of betaine, nonanoic acid, benzoic acid and perillic acid.

PMC4013650	D00013	The majority of PLs identified in this work, including different PCs and LPCs as well as SM(34:1), belong to the most abundant in their classes measured in human plasma samples; SM(38:3) and Cer(36:2) are less common species.
PMC4013650	D00025	In contrast to PCs and LPCs, which indicated decreased levels during radiotherapy and were compensated during the follow-up, both identified sphingomyelines showed significant radiation-related up-regulation only: SM(38:3) during earlier stage of the treatment while SM(34:1) during later stage of the treatment or subsequent follow-up.
PMC4013650	D00026	New SM molecules were most probably generated from degraded PC compounds by SM synthase (this transferase utilizes a choline “head” from PC) and suitable ceramide molecules, which was coherent with observed down-regulation of Cer(36:2).

PMC4132238	D00015	In that study, 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid was upregulated in dementia progressors, similar to what was observed here, which may be indicative of a role of hypoxia in the early dementia pathogenesis.
PMC4132238	D00016	Docosapentaenoic acid was upregulated in a previous study of mild cognitive impairment and also at the presymptomatic stage in a lipidomic analysis of brain tissues and plasma from a mouse model of AD, which converges with the present observations.
PMC4132238	R00027	Three metabolites were identified that contributed to the group separation in both studies: 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and uric acid.
PMC4159123	D04007	Decenedioic acid is a dicarboxylic acid.

PMC4169337	D01000	12-HETE and 15-HETE are products of lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 enzymes and exert both pro and anti-inflammatory effects.
PMC4169337	D01001	12-HETE is reported to augment tumour metastatic potential through activation of protein kinase C. 12-LOX has been shown to be elevated in HCC tumours and in HepG2 and L02 HCC cell lines, and studies show attenuation of HCC proliferation by 12-LOX inhibitor baecalein.
PMC4169337	D01002	The Endogenous production of 12-HETE has also been observed in solid tumours (stomach, lung colon, melanoma) and has been shown to enhance the potential for tumour cell metastasis.
PMC4169337	D01003	15-HETE was recently shown to promote HCC growth and metastasis through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/heat shock protein 90 (PI3K/Akt/HSP90) pathway.

PMC4169337	R12015	The 15-lipooxygenase product 15-HETE, a lipid signalling eicosanoid involved in inflammation and endothelial cell adhesion, was also identified as a potentially important metabolic signature of HCC, possessing a sensitivity of 83.3 and a specificity of 59.3 for HCC presence (AUC = 0.705, P = 0.0011).

PMC4270876	D00008	Also, the fatty acid composition of these two species is different (primary constituent of PC 38:6a is PC 16:0/22:6 while that for PC 38:6b is PC 18:2/20:4).
PMC4270876	D00009	Interestingly, several other members of cluster 1 contain the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6) although some also contain the omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4).
PMC4277370	D00049	Elevation of these metabolites can be an indication of decreased carbon flow into the TCA cycle or excess production of acetyl-CoA (or propionyl-CoA in the case of AHB increases) –.
PMC4336096	A02002	Moreover, LysoPC(20:4) also arose as a potential SR biomarker, increasing the prediction power of age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms, and diabetes scale (ABCD2) and LAA.
PMC4336096	A02004	Finally, a potential LAA biomarker, LysoPC(22:6), was also described.
PMC4336096	D00006	Low plasma levels of LysoPC(16:0) arose as a potential predictor of recurrence, especially in patients with early SR.
PMC4336096	D00008	Moreover, high levels of Lp-PLA2 and LysoPC(16:0) are associated with symptomatic carotid plaques.
PMC4336096	D00009	LysoPC(16:0) by itself increases on brain after stroke where it mediates phagocyte recruiting that can contribute to ischemic brain injury and also produces neuroinflammatory effects when applied on CNS.
PMC4336096	D00010	All these results could pinpoint a beneficial effect of reduced LysoPC(16:0) levels that argue against our claim that it marks an early SR risk, but although high levels of plaque LysoPC(16:0) are correlated with high plasma and plaque levels of Lp-PLA2, plasma LysoPC(16:0) levels are not.
PMC4336096	D00011	It has been demonstrated that plasma LysoPC(16:0) can inhibit Lp-PLA2 activity both in vitro and in vivo, thereby suppressing their neuroinflammative properties.
PMC4336096	D00012	Apart from suppressing Lp-PLA2 activity, plasmatic LysoPC(16:0) is neuroprotective on brain ischemia models, mainly through activation of TREK-1 potassium channels.
PMC4336096	D00013	Finally, it is known that LysoPC(16:0) is a potent inducer of superoxide ion production in endothelial cells and controlled levels of superoxide serve as angiogenic factors in ischemic angiogenesis.
PMC4336096	D00014	Due to all these neuroprotective properties, decreased plasma levels of LysoPC(16:0) could contribute to an early SR risk.
PMC4336096	D00015	Nonetheless, when we evaluated potential risk models accounting LysoPC(16:0), it did not add a significant value over the clinical parameters explained by ABCD2 and LAA presence.
PMC4336096	D00016	This fits with the fact that ABCD2 and LAA are closely related to pathophysiologic events previously invoked in the homeostasis of LysoPC16:0 (enumerated above).
PMC4336096	D00017	The potential implication of LysoPC metabolism in SR was further reinforced by the finding of LysoPC(20:4) as a potential biomarker of SR based on ROC curves of aggregated cohorts.
PMC4336096	D00018	Interestingly, after the use of NRI, IDI, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test, the statistics indicated that LysoPC(20:4) significantly improves prediction capacities of combined ABCD2 and LAA scores.
PMC4336096	D00022	Finally, we identified LysoPC(22:6) as a potential LAA biomarker.

PMC4544761	A00004	Plasma 20-HETE was highest in subjects with renovascular disease (median: 1.20 ng/mL; range: 0.42 to 1.92 ng/mL) compared with subjects with essential hypertension (median: 0.90 ng/mL; range: 0.40 to 2.17 ng/mL) and control subjects (median: 0.45 ng/mL; range: 0.14 to 1.70 ng/mL; P <0.05).

PMC4544761	A02003	CYP monooxygenases are expressed in the renal vasculature and nephron, generating primarily 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) by ω - and ω -1 hydroxylases and 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenases.
PMC4544761	A02004	The several individual isozymes that produce 20-HETE and EETs are independently regulated.
PMC4544761	A02006	20-HETE exhibits both pressor and antipressor activities._, 20-HETE mediates renal circulatory autoregulation and contributes to pressure natriuresis.
PMC4544761	A02008	Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) produces increased EETs with decreased blood pressure in experimental and genetic hypertension in rats _– Ang II stimulates 20-HETE synthesis in renal microvessels_, and decreases EET levels by downregulating epoxygenases and increasing their degradation by increasing expression and activity of sEH._, These studies provide the rationale to the hypothesis that occasioned the present study; namely, metabolism of AA via CYP monooxygenases is altered in renovascular disease (RVD).
PMC4544761	A02009	To assess whether altered generation of eicosanoids derived from CYP AA metabolism occurs with activation of the renin-angiotensin system, we set up a cross-sectional study to measure 20-HETE, EET, and DHET levels in plasma and urine by paired analyses in hypertensive subjects with RVD that were compared with these levels in normotensive control subjects and those with EH.
PMC4544761	D00000	The present study identified differences between subjects with RVD and those with either EH or normal blood pressure (control subjects) in terms of disparities between the 2 groups in their plasma levels and urinary excretion of EETs and 20-HETE and metabolism of EETs to DHETs.
PMC4544761	D00001	Subjects with RVD exhibited increased plasma 20-HETEs, reduced excretion of 20-HETE, decreased plasma EETs, and increased plasma DHETs.
PMC4544761	D00003	However, because EETs and 20-HETE are essential components of renal vascular and transport mechanisms that regulate blood pressure, their alterations in RVD can be conditionally linked to elevation of blood pressure, as the following analysis will attempt to disclose.
PMC4544761	D00006	In the present study, PRA correlated positively with plasma levels of 20-HETE in subjects with RVD.
PMC4544761	D00007	Ang II can activate the release of renal 20-HETE by stimulating the synthesis of 20-HETE at critical sites in the kidney: the preglomerular microvessels that determine renovascular resistance and a nephron segment, the medullary thick ascending limb, that contributes decisively to salt and water balance.
PMC4544761	D00008	The pressor response to increases in circulating Ang II can be attenuated by inhibition of 20-HETE synthesis.
PMC4544761	D00009	Furthermore, overexpression of an ω -hydroxylase isozyme, which increased the production of 20-HETE in blood vessels, caused endothelial dysfunction.
PMC4544761	D00010	Either deficient or excessive renal production of 20-HETE was reported to elevate blood pressure.
PMC4544761	D00011	In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, increased renal 20-HETE contributes to elevation of blood pressure, whereas in the salt-sensitive Dahl rat, reduced 20-HETE synthesis also elevates blood pressure.
PMC4544761	D00012	The prohypertensive effects of either increased or decreased renal 20-HETE production depends on the principal site, either a nephron segment such as the TAL (decreased 20-HETE) or renal microvessels (increased 20-HETE) as the afferent arteriole, that exhibits altered synthesis of 20-HETE.
PMC4544761	D00013	Increased synthesis of 20-HETE by preglomerular microvessels elevates renovascular resistance, reducing intravascular pressures in the medullary circulation, promoting movement of fluid into the vasa rectae with expansion of extracellular fluid volume and elevation of blood pressure.
PMC4544761	D00014	By way of contrast, 20-HETE, which inhibits Na_+ -K_+ -2Cl_− cotransporter activity in the TAL, will promote Na_+ reabsorption and elevate blood pressure when deficient, as in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat.
PMC4544761	D00015	The 4 isoforms/isozymes of ω -hydroxylase that synthesize 20-HETE are differentially localized in the kidney and individually regulated, eg, the 4A8 isoform is regulated by testosterone.
PMC4544761	D00017	Decreased urinary concentration of 20-HETE, associated with RVD, may reflect diminished 20-HETE production by nephron segments, the TAL and proximal tubules.
PMC4544761	D00018	As 20-HETE functions in these segments to inhibit Na_+ reabsorption, a deficiency will promote Na_+ reabsorption and elevate blood pressure as occurs in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat.
PMC4544761	D00019	The elevated plasma concentrations of 20-HETE in RVD occurred with decreased urinary excretion of 20-HETE and probably reflects the multiple pathways for disposition of 20-HETE, namely, incorporation of 20-HETE into phospholipids, ω - and β -oxidation, and transformation of 20-HETE via cyclooxygenase into prostaglandin analogs._,
PMC4544761	D00020	In addition, separate sites of origin, vasculature and renal tubules, can account for differences in plasma and urinary levels of 20-HETE.
PMC4544761	D00021	In humans, 20-HETE is excreted primarily as a glucuronide conjugate, as we have confirmed in the present study.
PMC4544761	D00022	This pathway of 20-HETE excretion was not found in the rat but is greatly increased in human hepatic cirrhosis.
PMC4544761	D00030	Diminished EET levels will augment 20-HETE vasoconstrictor activity, because 11,12-EET functions as a physiological antagonist of 20-HETE.
PMC4544761	D00031	Deficiency of 11,12-EET has also been linked to salt-sensitive hypertension, because 11,12-EET inhibits the epithelial sodium channel in the rat collecting duct.
PMC4544761	D00032	Moreover, impairment of 11,12-EET synthesis in mice produced by disruption of the gene-controlling EET synthase caused salt-sensitive hypertension.
PMC4544761	D01001	Decline in the urinary excretion of 20-HETE in RVD was suggested to reflect decreased 20-HETE production by the TAL and proximal tubules that may contribute to increased Na_+ reabsorption in these tubular segments.
PMC4544761	D01002	Circulating 20-HETE was positively correlated with PRA in RVD and may contribute to elevation of blood pressure by increasing vasomotion and enhancing vascular reactivity.

PMC4544761	M02008	The ions m/z of 319 and 327 were monitored for endogenous and deuterium (d8)-labeled EETs, the ions m/z of 391 and 397 were monitored for 20-HETE, and the ions m/z of 481 and 489 were monitored for DHETs.
PMC4544761	R00007	Plasma and urinary levels of 20-HETE were significantly different among the 3 groups; subjects with RVD demonstrated the highest plasma and the lowest urinary values of 20-HETE.
PMC4544761	R00008	Plasma 20-HETE in control subjects was one third that of RVD, whereas urinary excretion of 20-HETE in control subjects was 2- to 3-fold higher.
PMC4544761	R00009	The urinary excretion of 20-HETE was reduced in patients with RVD whether expressed as micrograms per hour or when factored for urinary excretion of creatinine.
PMC4544761	R00010	Statistically significant differences were observed in plasma concentration (A) and urinary excretion (B and C) of 20-HETE between patients with RVD and healthy control subjects.
PMC4544761	R00022	This analysis failed to discern differences among the 3 groups in their regioisomeric composition; the 14,15-EET predominated and the 11,12-EET was least.
PMC4544761	R00026	The levels of 5,6-EET cannot be accurately estimated because of its lability.
PMC4544761	R00033	A statistically significant positive correlation between plasma 20-HETE and PRA was observed within the group of patients with RVD, as well as the whole study population.
PMC4544761	R00034	Plasma 20-HETE and plasma DHETs were positively correlated only when all of the subjects were included (r _s =0.538; P =0.002; please see ).

PMC4778071	D01005	It is well known that 12,13-DiHOME is produced in humans from linoleic acid, via its oxidation (by P450 monoxygenase) to the protoxin 12,13-EpOME (isoleukotoxin), followed by conversion to 12,13-DiHOME via the 12,13-EpOME by sEH.
PMC4778071	D01007	Both 12,13-DiHOME and 12,13-EpOME are PPAR-γ ligands with potentially wide-ranging effects.

PMC6292875	R02000	According to the results of the fold change (threshold >=2) analysis and the t-tests (threshold =<0.05), eight key plasmatic metabolites in the ATG, including sucrose, cellobiose, glycine, hypoxanthine, hexanoic acid, ketoglutaric acid, threonine, and uric acid, were significantly altered, and thus were selected as important features.
PMC6292875	R02005	Five key metabolites, including sucrose, cellobiose, hypoxanthine, ketoglutaric acid, and hexanoic acid, were selected as markers for the ATG by using a VIP threshold of 1.5.

PMC6314687	M03000	Stock solutions of standard compounds were prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 100 ng/μL for all analytes except 1000 ng/uL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE. An intermediate stock solution of the 50 analytes was prepared at 1 ng/uL for all analytes except 10 ng/uL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE by mixing stock solutions of each analyte in methanol.
PMC6314687	M03007	Calibrator working solutions were prepared by dilution from this intermediate stock solution with methanol to achieve concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng/mL for all analytes except 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 50,000, and 10,000 ng/mL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE. The quality control (QC) working solutions were prepared separately in the same fashion at five concentrations of 2, 5, 10, 100, and 800 ng/mL for all analytes except 20, 50, 100, 1000, and 8000 ng/mL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE. Both working solutions of calibrators and QCs were aliquoted.
PMC6314687	M04003	The calibration standards were prepared by spiking with 20 μL of the appropriate calibrator working solution into 700 μL of PMC in Eppendorf tube kept in ice, resulting in the calibration concentrations of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 ng/mL for all analytes except 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng/mL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE in the final solution.

PMC6314687	R03000	When highly specific LC-MS/MS MRM with unique transition is used, the chromatographic separation is often not required such as in co-eluting pairs of regioisomers, 5-HETE and 8-HETE, 9-HETE and 15-HETE, 8,9-EET and 12-EET, 7-HDHA and 10-HDHA.
PMC6314687	R03011	Two pairs of regioisomers, 9-HETE and 11-HETE (319 > 167), 7-HDHA and 17-HDHA (343 > 245) were nearly baseline separated.
PMC6314687	R03013	Furthermore, for coeluting isomers 9-HODE and 13-HODE, and partially resolved isomers 9-EpOME and 13-EpOME, 9-HODE and 9-EpOME were each found to produce a very minor peak at m/z 195, forming an MRM transition 295 > 195, corresponding to less than 1% of the response at the same concentration level for 13-HODE and 13-EpOME.
PMC6314687	R05009	By contrast, neutral loading without acidification of the loading solution greatly improved recovery of 13-H-9-E-LA (86.9 to 107.1% across concentration range) and achieved good recoveries for all other analytes except 5,6-EET, although these acidic analytes would likely be charged at a neutral condition.
PMC6314687	R06001	gave the overall recovery of analytes at these concentration levels ranging from 68.9 to 114.6% with RSD less than 15% for majority of analytes except low recovery for 5,6-EET that has been discussed in the section of Recovery and matrix effects below.
PMC6314687	R09002	Stability of 5,6-EET and deuterated 5,6-EET-d_11 decreased to 61 and 57%, respectively, at this storage condition for plasma extract at 24 h relative to 0 h.
PMC6314687	R09003	This decrease may be due to instability of 5,6-EET in acidic and neutral conditions [, ].
PMC6314687	R09004	Loss of 5,6-EET during sample storage was compensated by the use of deuterated 5,6-EET-d_11 as internal standard during quantitation of 5,6-EET as shown in .
PMC6314687	R09007	The results revealed all analytes except 5,6-EET are stable in the reconstitute solution at 4 °C within the duration of 24 h.
PMC6314687	R10006	The interday RSDs ranged from 4.3 to 15.0% for 44 out of 50 across the concentration levels and 16.7% for 12,13-EpOME at LLOQ level except five analytes (13-oxoODE, 9,12,13-TriHOME, 13-H-9-E-LA, 9-H-12-E-LA, and 11-H-12-E-LA) with RSDs of 21.7–27.7% at LLOQ or medium QC levels.
PMC6314687	R10010	The interday RSDs for 35 out of 50 were ≤ 15% across the concentration range, for 10 of 50 analytes between 15 and 20% at LOQ or LLOQ levels, and except for 5 of 50 analytes (9-oxoODE, 13-oxoODE, 13-HOTrE, 18-HEPE, and 17-HDHA) that had RSDs ranging between 23.3 and 30.1% at LOQ, or LLOQ levels.
PMC6314687	R10011	A significant batch-to-batch variation has been observed for 13-HOTrE and 18-HEPE (as high as 70%).
PMC6314687	R10012	It is worth mentioning that four analytes 9,10-EpOME, 12,13-EpOME, 9,10,13-TriHOME and 9,12,13-TriHOME showed good sensitivity, but large variations were observed for the concentrations between LOQs and LLOQs (data not shown), which will require further investigation.
PMC6314687	R11004	Forty-nine out of the of 50 analytes showed recoveries in the range of 66.8 to 121.2% except 5,6-EET that showed recoveries of 38.3–66.2% across three QC concentration levels (QC3 to QC5) in PMC and plasma.
PMC6314687	R11005	Since no matrix suppression was observed, low recoveries of 5,6-EET most likely resulted from degradation and losses during sample preparation, which were compensated by the use of deuterated 5,6-EET-d_11 as indicated in its accuracy determination.
PMC6314687	R11007	oxoODE (21.9% in PMC), 13-HOTrE (25.5% in plasma), and 20-HETE (21.8% in PMC) at the lowest QC1level.
PMC6314687	R12005	Our results of higher 12-HETE levels in serum than in plasma corroborate earlier investigations [, , ].
PMC6314687	R12006	Higher levels of the 12-LOX products 12-HETE and 14-HDHA in serum are likely due to activation of platelet-derived 12-LOX during the clotting cascade.
PMC6315409	D00007	An example of this involves the conversion of 20-HETE to ω-hydroxy arachidonic acid, and the subsequent conversion to 20-carboxy arachidonic acid (DCA 20:4) by alcohol dehydrogenase and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase.
PMC6315767	A00004	The differentiated metabolites identified in the CD samples included tyrosine, an ornithine isomer, arachidonic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, docosatetraenoic acid, a sphingomyelin, a ceramide, and dimethylsphinganine.
PMC6315767	D00034	Dietary omega 6 fatty acids that include arachidonic acid and eicosatrienoic acid may be implicated in IBD.
PMC6315767	D00035	In our study, the levels of arachidonic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, and docosatetraenoic acid were much higher in the CD patients compared to the HC group ( and ) and remained high both pre- and post-EEN treatment.
PMC6315767	R01053	To confirm their identity, two marker fatty acids, arachidonic acid and eicosatrienoic acid, were matched against the retention times of their corresponding standards on a C4 reversed phase column.
PMC6316279	D00004	Cholesterol levels are largely controlled by the liver, which is the major source of cholesterol and LDL via very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production, and also the major site of LDL catabolism.

PMC6316614	M01004	All other organic acid standards including lactic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, citric acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, propionic acid, p-hydroxyhippuric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, pyruvic acid, hippuric acid, methylmalonic acid, homovanillic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, uric acid, and their isotope-labeled standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
PMC6316856	D00038	They also found changes in some SM species, such as an increase in SM16:0 and a decrease in SM20:0 concentration.
PMC6316856	R04005	Propionylcarnitine and other BCAA-derived AC, as well as the phosphatidylcholines PCae C36:3, PCaa C36:2 and sphingomyelin SM OH C22:1 had higher concentrations in samples collected before surgery, while SM 16:0, SM 18:0, SM 18:1, the acylcarnitine 3-Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4:OH) and the phosphatidylcholines PCaa C32:2 and PCae C32:1 were increased in blood collected 90 days after the RYGB surgery.
PMC6325166	M03007	For FA 18:1, the EPI mode in negative ion mode was applied for LC–PB–MS/MS analysis.
PMC6325166	R01006	The performance of the FEP flow microreactor for the PB reaction was evaluated using model lipid PC 16:0/18:1(9Z) under similar solvent compositions as used in HILIC separation.
PMC6325166	R03006	For instance, the peak at m/z 718.6 in 141 Da NLS (monoisotopic molecular mass: 717.6 Da, RT: 5.2 min) was identified as PE 16:0_18:1, based on the detection of fatty acyl anions at m/z 255 (C16:0) and m/z 281 (C18:1) (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6325166	R03009	In subsequent LC–PB–MS/MS analysis, the protonated PB reaction product of PE 16:0_18:1 (m/z 776.3, [_PB M+H]_+ ) was selected for beam-type CID.
PMC6325166	R03011	These diagnostic ions clearly suggested the existence of Δ9 and Δ11 C=C locations for the C18:1 chain of PE 16:0_18:1, thus identifying the C=C location isomers as PE 16:0_18:1(Δ9) and PE 16:0_18:1(Δ11)
PMC6325166	R03021	d LC–PB–MS/MS of PE 34:1 (RT: 5.7 min, m/z 776.3) reveals the presence of two C=C location isomers, PE 16:0_18:1(Δ9) and PE 16:0_18:1(Δ11).

PMC6325166	R03023	z 840.4) and f PC 16:0_20:4 (RT: 14.3 min, m/z 840.4).
PMC6325166	R03043	For instance, the Relative Intensity% (Rel. Int.%) of PE 39:4 (monoisotopic molecular mass: 781.5622 Da, m/z 782.6) was less than 2% of the most abundant species in the subclass (PE 38:4, m/z 768.6) (Fig.
PMC6325166	R03046	These would have had a severe adverse impact on the identification of C=C locations in PE 39:4 if PB–MS/MS analysis was directly applied to the lipid extract.
PMC6325166	R03047	As a contrast, LC–PB–MS/MS offered high quality data for PE 39:4 ([_PB M+H]_+ , m/z 840.4, Fig. ), from which four pairs of fragment ions could be picked out as C=C diagnostic ions (m/z 453/479, 493/519, 533/559, and 573/599).
PMC6325166	R03048	Combining information from fatty acyl composition (C17:0 and C22:4), this PE was confidently identified as PE 17:0_22:4 (Δ7, 10, 13, and 16), with no other major C=C location isomer identified.
PMC6325166	R03049	Similarly, its isomer, PC 36:4, was identified as PC 16:0_20:4 (Δ5, 8, 11, and 14) (Fig. ).
PMC6325166	R03065	Interestingly, for PE 18:1_18:1 and PC 18:1_18:1, we also detected relatively low intensity C=C diagnostic ions that could be assigned as the Δ10 isomer, although other unusual structural isomer may also be possible (i.e. branched fatty acyl (Me-C17:1(Δ9)).
PMC6325166	R04000	In a previous study, a shotgun lipid analysis incorporated with the PB reaction revealed significant changes in the C=C isomer compositions of C18:1 (Δ9/Δ11) for PC 18:0_18:1 and PC 18:1_18:1.
PMC6325166	R04010	Only six lipid species (PC 32:1, PC 34:2, PC 34:1, PE 36:1, PE 38:4, and PE 40:7) out of 109 identified PCs and PEs were found to have statistically significant changes (P  < 0.001, determined by two-tailed student’s t test, average RSD: 27 ± 12%, mean ± s.d.
PMC6325166	R04012	This result is consistent with literature reports, where PE 34:1, PE 36:2, PE 38:4, PC 32:1, and PC 36:2 have been identified to have significant changes in breast cancer cell lines or tissue samples.
PMC6325166	R04014	Relative quantitation of a PCs and b PEs at subclass level between normal and cancerous breast tissue samples by LC–MS/MS (PC 15:0/15:0 and PE 15:0/15:0 used as internal standards).
PMC6325166	R04028	Significant changes were still observed for these lipid isomers, except for PC 19:0_18:1 (corrected value of −0.0005).
PMC6325166	R04029	Among those, only two overlapped with the ones exhibiting significant changes at subclass level analysis, i.e. PC 16:0_18:1 and PE 18:0_18:1.
PMC6325166	R04031	For instance, C=C isomer compositional analysis revealed that PE 34:1 consisted of two C=C location isomers, PE 16:0_18:1(Δ9) and PE 16:0_18:1(Δ11)
PMC6325166	R04040	It is worth noting that the relative ratios of Δ9/Δ11 isomers of free FA 18:1 did not show significant changes between the normal (8.9 ± 0.7, N  = 6) and cancerous tissue samples (7.4 ± 0.5, N  = 6) (Supplementary Figs.
PMC6325166	R05008	It is worth noting that by using a much larger sampling size, i.e., 70 plasma samples, previously Wang et al. discovered significant changes at subclass level for PE 38:4 and PE 38:6 in T2D plasma samples.
PMC6325166	R05012	Some C=C location isomers, previously not discovered in tissue samples, were also identified, such as Δ10 vs. Δ12 isomers for PC O-16:1/16:0 and ω-6 vs. ω-9 isomer pair of C18:2 in PC 15:0_18:2 (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6325166	R05021	There is no obvious trend in the changes of the Δ9/Δ11 isomers and neither do the changes correlate with relative isomeric composition in free FA 18:1 (I _Δ9 /I _Δ11  = 10.5 ±
PMC6325166	R05024	For instance, the relative isomeric ratio (I _Δ9 /I _Δ11 ) in PE 16:0_18:1 decreased from 5.0 ± 0.5 in control to 3.7 ± 0.3 in T2D, while the ratio of PC 18:1_20:4 increased from 2.4 ± 0.4 in control to 4.8 ± 0.9 in T2D. These data suggest that the metabolic processes associated with these isomeric species responded quite differently under the T2D conditions.

PMC6325166	R05037	Using relative quantitation of PE 16:0_18:1 as an example, RSDs from three technical repeats of one individual are all round 8% for normal control and T2D samples (Fig.
PMC6325166	R05040	IS  = 0.6 ± 0.4, N = 6) for relative quantitation of PE 16:0_18:1.
PMC6325166	R05041	When counting Δ9/Δ11 relative isomer ratios for PE 16:0_18:1, the RSDs (8%) of the technique repeats are quite comparable to that of subclass quantitation; however, individual-to-individual variation is significantly reduced, at 10% for normal control (I _Δ9 /I _Δ11  = 5.0 ± 0.5) and 11% for T2D (I _Δ9 /I _Δ11  = 3.8 ± 0.4).

PMC6382115	R08007	The correlation analysis of LPC with PC species resulted in significant positive associations in most cases, except for LPC 14:0 and PC 38:6.
PMC6382115	R08009	With the exception of PC 38:6, most PC species also correlated with GPCe.
PMC6382115	R08010	Considering the associations between PC and SM as well as GPCe and SM species, only SM 22:3 did not correlate with most PC and GPCe species.
PMC6382115	R08013	Among the lipids investigated, fewer than ten correlations were found for LPC 14:0 (8), PC 26:0 (7), PC 36:0 (5), PC 40:1 (9), GPCe 42:0 (5), GPCe 42:5 (7), GPCe 44:5 and SM 22:3 (2).
PMC6382115	R08014	GPCe 44:4 was correlated only with GPCe 38:1, and GPCe 30:1 was correlated only with PC 40:2.
PMC6382115	R09002	This is in accordance with publications showing, that the assembly of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) into sperm lipids during the maturation of sperm in the epididymis increases the fluidity of the membrane and, thus, promotes the motility of the sperm cells [,].
PMC6382115	R09014	A significant positive correlation with normomorphic sperm was found for the levels of PC 42:6, GPCe 42:0, GPCe 42:5 and SM 22:3 in seminal plasma.
PMC6391464	R01060	One feature (M327T82 in Table ) was identified as Docosahexaenoic acid (Metlin ID: 3457, HMDB0002183) with a METLIN score of 58 and a HMDB fit of 85%.
PMC6391464	R01062	Docosahexaenoic acid is an important structural component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, and the discs of the rod photoreceptor cells.
PMC6391464	R01064	Since docosahexaenoic acid was the only lipid that was found in this study the cause of its enrichment in incubations with alpha-PEP remains speculative.
PMC6397561	D00056	Only one PC in our study significantly increased in fatalities, PC(16:0/16:0).
PMC6397561	D00057	The exclusive increase of PC(16:0/16:0) supports fatty liver disease with EVD, as PC(32:0) was recently reported as a potential signature of progressive forms of fatty liver disease.
PMC6397561	D00070	These values would be expected to be greater in Sierra Leoneans as their daily intake of 22:6 in the form of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is greater than most other countries, summarized by Forsyth et al..
PMC6397561	M04006	Lipid standards BMP(14:0/14:0) and PG(14:0/14:0) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., and analyzed using the same LC-MS parameters as the plasma samples.
PMC6397561	R01004	Eight PS lipids were identified and were statistically (P value <0.05) higher in fatalities in our study, with the exception of PS(18:0_20:4) ( and SI Appendix , Table S2).
PMC6397561	R01009	Platelets, common sources of MVs, have been shown to externalize PS(18:0_18:1) and PS(18:0_20:4) from the inner to outer membrane when activated by thrombin.
PMC6397561	R01010	Lipidomics studies of exosomes generated from prostate cancer 3 (PC-3) cells specifically identified two PS lipids, PS(18:0_18:1) and PS(18:0_22:6), that were elevated and exclusively identified in exosomes vs. the parent cells, respectively.
PMC6397561	R01011	Raw peak intensity values of these three PS lipids from our data revealed that PS(18:0_18:1) and PS(18:0_20:4) were the most abundant PS lipids followed by PS(18:0_22:6).
PMC6397561	R01012	As previous studies have shown that lipid ratios can be predictive of certain diseases, we noted that when the raw intensity value of PS(18:0_20:4) was divided by the sum of the raw intensity values of these three PS lipids, all fatal outcomes had a value of less than 28.5 (average value of 21) ( and SI Appendix , Fig.
PMC6397561	R01016	The PS ratio trend remained similar when PS(18:0_20:4) was divided by the sum of all PS lipids (SI Appendix , Fig.

PMC6397561	R01052	LC-MS/MS analysis of reference standards BMP(14:0/14:0) and PG(14:0/14:0) revealed that BMPs eluted 1.9 min earlier than PG (SI Appendix , Fig.
PMC6397561	R02006	The only statistically significant PC lipid that increased in fatalities was PC(16:0/16:0) (P value 0.003) ( and ).
PMC6397561	R02007	Interestingly, PC(32:0), which could correspond to PC(16:0/16:0), was recently reported as a potential signature of progressive forms of fatty liver disease.
PMC6397561	R02015	The only PC lipid that is statistically significant and increased in fatal (F) vs. control (C) is PC(16:0/16:0).
PMC6397561	R02016	Gorden et al. reported that PC(32:0), which could be PC(16:0/16:0), may be a lipid signature of progressive forms of fatty liver disease.
PMC6400388	D00007	Interestingly, plasma SM levels (SM 36:1, SM 38:1, and SM 40:1), which are related with fatty liver and insulin resistance as well as obesity, were significantly elevated in pre-diabetic individuals with AO when compared to normal individuals with AO or pre-diabetic without AO ( and ).
PMC6400388	M04007	An IS for each lipid class were selected for single-point calibrations of each target lipid species (LPC 17:1, LPC 17:1, LPE 17:1, PC 31:1(17:0/14:1), PC 31:1(17:0/14:1), PC 31:1(17:0/14:1), PE 31:1(17:0/14:1), PE 31:1(17:0/14:1), SM 30:1(d18:1/12:0), ceramide 15:1, CE 15:0, DAG 16:0(8:0/8:0), and TAG 45:0(15:0/15:0/15:0) for LPC, plasmenyl LPC, LPE, PC, plasmenyl PC, plasmanyl PC, PE, plasmenyl PE, SM, ceramide, CE, DAG, and TAG class, respectively).
PMC6400388	R02004	Higher concentrations (> 20 μM) of SM 34:1, 36:1, 38:1, 40:1, 40:2, 42:2, and 42:3 were found in the plasma.
PMC6400388	R02006	In addition, Pre-DM patients with AO had significantly higher levels of SM36:1, SM38:1 and SM40:1 than normal subjects with AO.
PMC6400388	R02007	Taken together, these data suggest that SM36:1, SM38:1 and SM40:1 among lipid species might be putative diagnostic markers in pre-diabetic patients with AO.
PMC6416208	A00003	SPMs are multiple hydroxylated fatty acids including resolvins, maresins, and protectins derived from the n3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as lipoxins derived from arachidonic acid (ARA).
PMC6416208	R06004	15-lipoxygenation products were quantified only in low concentrations (≤1 nM) and SPM precursor 18-HEPE was <LLOQ in >50% of the samples.
PMC6416208	R06007	A trend toward higher 5- and 12-lipoxygenation and lower 15-lipoxygenation products and 18-HEPE in peritonitis could be observed with high inter-individual variation, while for SPMs no consistent trend toward an elevation or reduction in peritonitis was observed.
PMC6416286	D00039	However, only TG (49:1) and TG (51:1) were identified as putative biomarkers when the lipidome was compared between meloxicam- and saline-treated cats and within the meloxicam group (post-treatment vs baseline lipidome)
PMC6416286	D00041	In urine, LPC (16:1) was the only lipid that was identified as biomarker candidate to discriminate meloxicam- vs saline-treated cats and post- and pre-meloxicam administration (Fig. ).
PMC6416286	R04005	Six lipids, DG (36:4), TG (56:2), TG (54:1), TG (49:1), TG (51:1) and TG (56:3), were identified as potential biomarker candidates to discriminate saline and meloxicam-treated cats.
PMC6416286	R05001	Six lipids, TG (51:1), TG (49:1), TG (56:6), TG (48:1), TG (54:6)B and SM (d42:2)A were identified as potential biomarker candidates for monitoring meloxicam-treated cats.
PMC6416286	R06001	LPC (16:1), TG (46:4)A, TG (42:3) and TG (46:3) were statistically different in the meloxicam and saline-treated cats (p  = 0.002, 0.017, 0.012 and 0.028, respectively).
PMC6416286	R07003	Applying the same criteria used for the plasma lipidome to select the biomarker candidates, five lipids, LPC (16:1), PC (33:1), PC (35:4)B, PC (36:5)B and PC (36:6), discriminated meloxicam-treated from saline-treated cats.
PMC6416286	R07006	In general, the abundances of LPC (16:1) and PC (33:1) were higher in the meloxicam group than those in the control group.
PMC6416286	R07007	However, the abundances of PC (35:4)B, PC (36:5)B and PC (36:6) were lower in the meloxicam group than those in the control group.
PMC6416286	R07008	Notably, the LPC (16:1) was selected for time points 2 and 3 (Fig. ).
PMC6416286	R08004	On the contrary, the abundances of LPC (17:1), LPC (16:1), PC (32:1) and PE (p-36:4) were lower in the meloxicam group after the administration of the drug  relative to baseline.
PMC6426235	A00005	Sex-related differences include higher LDL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol, particular sphingomyelins (SM), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing phospholipid levels in females.
PMC6426235	D03003	In particular, SM(d18:1/23:1) and SM(d18:1/24:2) were elevated in females, which has previously been reported [, ] and could potentially be accounted for by differences in LDL-C cholesterol levels.
PMC6426235	D03008	DHA-containing fatty acids in plasma phospholipids, such as PE(18:0/22:6), PE(16:0/22:6) and PE(18:1/22:6) and PC(18:0/22:6), were also reduced in males aged over 75 years, relative to females, an observation also reported in previous studies [, ].
PMC6426235	M06003	The deuterated internal standards used were: Cer(d18:1/12:0), SM (d18:1/12:0), d _5 TG(d16:0/18:0/16:0) and d _5 DG(19:0/19:0).
PMC6426235	M06004	The odd-carbon chain structural analog internal standards were cholesterol ester (CE) CE(19:0), phosphatidylcholine PC(19:0/19:0), phosphatidylethanolamine PE(17:0/17:0), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) LPC(19:0).
PMC6426235	M09002	The raw abundances (peak areas) were normalised by dividing each peak area by the raw abundance of the corresponding internal standard for that lipid class e.g. all ceramides were normalised using Cer(d18:1/12:0).
PMC6426235	R06002	In particular, SM(d18:1/24:2) and SM(d18:1/23:1) were higher in females than males, and SM(d18:1/25:3) trended higher in females (p = 0.07).
PMC6426235	R06003	Among subjects aged over 75 years, females also had higher levels of DHA–containing phospholipids including PE(18:0/22:6) and PC(18:0/22:6) in positive mode, and PE(18:1/22:6), and PE(16:0/22:6) in negative mode, with PI(16:0/22:6) trending higher but not reaching significance (, p = 0.06).
PMC6426235	R06005	Additionally, among females, PC(18:0/22:6), PE(16:0/22:6), PE(18:0/22:6) and PE(18:1/22:6) correlated with enzymatically assayed TG levels (r = 0.48, 0.48, 0.59 and 0.43 respectively, p<0.01), while PE(16:0/22:6), PE(18:0/22:6) and PE(18:1/22:6) were also negatively correlated with LDL-C levels (r = -0.37, -0.35, and -0.46 respectively, p<0.02) independent of age and BMI.
PMC6440635	M04021	In brief, urine sample preparation consisted of 1) pre-extraction on a Sep-Pak C18 column with the recovery standard medroxyprogesterone, 2) enzymatic hydrolysis with sulfatase and β-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase, 3) extraction of the free steroids from the hydrolysis mixture again on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, 4) derivatization with methoxyamine HCl 2% in pyridine at 60°C for one hour after adding the two standards Stigmasterol and 3β5β-TH-aldosterone and derivatization with Trimethylsilylimidazole (TMSI) at 100°C for 16 hours, 5) purification by gel filtration on a Lipidex 5000 column.
PMC6457987	D01003	Two critical pairs derived from AA, including HETEs (19-HETE and 20-HETE) and EETs (11,12-EET and 8,9-EET) were chosen to demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transitions.
PMC6457987	D01005	Extracted ion chromatograms from LC-MRM-MS analysis of 19-HETE and 20-HETE (A), 11,12-EET and 8,9-EET (B) monitored at different transitions.
PMC6457987	D01007	used transition 319 301 ([M-H-H_2 O]-) as a surrogate of 20-HETE.
PMC6457987	D01010	Unfortunately, even when we used a 12 min LC gradient, the 19-HETE cannot be fully resolved from 20-HETE.
PMC6457987	D01011	For this critical pair, we found fragments m/z 231 (black, ) and m/z 245 (green, ) employed by Wang et al . were more selective to 19-HETE and 20-HETE, respectively, compared to the water-loss fragment, m/z 301 (red, ), which was common in both HETEs.
PMC6457987	D01012	Even though fragment ion m/z 301 was more intensive than other fragments, poor selectivity prevented it from separating 19-HETE and 20-HETE in the mixture (bottom, ).
PMC6457987	D01013	The EET pair displayed a slight difference in retention time (ΔRT=0.1) and the reported fragment ion m/z 167 (red, ) can be found in both 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET.
PMC6457987	D01014	The poor selectivity issue is not limited to oxylipins derived from AA, those derived from DHA, such as 14-HDoHE and 10-HDoHE also exhibited identical retention on LC.
PMC6457987	D01015	The fragment ion m/z 161 has been used as specific transition for 14-HDoHE in a previous study; however, we noticed it can be generated by 10-HDoHE as well.
PMC6457987	D01016	Besides, previous study employed fragment ion m/z 281([M-H-H_2 O-CO_2 ]-) to represent 17-HDoHE, yet, this water and CO_2 loss is common for all HDoHEs.
PMC6457987	D01017	Given this, good quantitation of 17-HDoHE would not be possible if there was not enough LC resolving power.
PMC6457987	D02020	For example, 16-HETE, 17-HETE and 18-HETE did not resolve well with a ΔRT of 0.07 min.
PMC6457987	D02021	Yet, through the heatmap analysis, we could easily identify m/z 233 (break between C-15 and C-16), m/z 247 (break between C-16 and C-17) and m/z 261 (break between C-17 and C-18) as unique fragment ion for 16-HETE, 17-HETE and 18 HETE, respectively.
PMC6457987	D02022	Alternatively, Willenberg et al . mentioned product ion spectra of 9-HETE and 12-HETE were similar and these two compounds must be separated chromatographically for their identification.

PMC6457987	D02027	The most dominant fragment ion for three chromatographically unresolved HDoHEs (11-HDoHE, 10-HDoHE and 14-HDoHE) is m/z 281
PMC6457987	D02030	However, the unique fragment ions m/z 149, m/z 153 and m/z 205 for 11-HDoHE, 10-HDoHE and 14-HDoHE, respectively, can be easily identified by visually inspecting the heatmap.

PMC6471885	R00002	Results are reported in Panels B-D. In particular, we selected phosphatidylcholines PCs (PC 34:1, PC 36:2 and PC 40:4) in Panel B, C0, ACs (C2, C3) in Panel C and AAs (Leu/Ile/Pro, Phe, Tyr, Glu, Met, Lys/Gln) in Panel D for the results to be retained in the first section (α) of the paper strip.

PMC6477036	D00024	We did, however, measure increased LPC species enriched for SaFAs, including LPC(17:0) and LPC(20:0), whereas the proportional amount of LPC(18:2) was significantly decreased.
PMC6477036	D00031	We did not observe significant associations among FFA levels and statin use, however levels of LPC(14:0) were significantly reduced in statin users (0.39 μM) compared to non-users (0.56 μM) (p = 0.04).
PMC6477036	M02001	Palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), and soy-derived lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCsoy) (Avanti Polar Lipids) were dissolved in 100% ethanol and filter-sterilized (10 mM stock solutions).
PMC6477036	R02012	Palmitic acid (16:0) levels were positively associated with inflammatory monocyte (CD14_+ CD16_+ ) surface expression of the innate immune receptor, TLR4, and myristic acid (14:0) was positively associated with levels of CD36, a scavenger receptor involved in immune signaling and lipid uptake.
PMC6477036	R02017	SR-A levels were inversely related to levels of the PUFA, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (22:5).
PMC6477036	R03002	There was a significant enrichment of LPC(17:0) and LPC(20:0), and LPC(18:0) tended to be increased in HIV+ individuals.
PMC6477036	R03003	We also measured significantly reduced proportional amounts of LPC (18:2) in HIV+ participants.
PMC6477036	R04002	LPCs enriched for the SaFA margaric acid (17:0) were positively associated with the proportion of patrolling monocytes, and LPC(20:0) was positively associated with surface expression of SR-A on patrolling monocytes and CD36 on inflammatory monocytes.
PMC6477036	R04003	LPC (18:3) was inversely associated with CD40 expression on inflammatory monocytes.
PMC6477036	R04010	Proportional amounts of LPC(15:0) were positively associated with both TC (r = 0.64, p = 0.004)
PMC6477036	R04012	The proportion of PUFA-enriched LPC (22:6) was positively associated with HDL (r = 0.53, p = 0.02) and inversely associated with TG levels (r = −0.45, p = 0.05).
PMC6477036	R05008	(D) Serum biomarkers of immune activation were inversely associated with PUFA-containing LPC species, and SaFA-containing LPC(16:0) was positively associated with ICAM1, a marker of endothelial cell activation.

PMC6521063	D00030	Alterations in phospholipid levels have been reported in pancreatic cancer patients, in whom LysoPC(18:2) was downregulated, while upregulation of this metabolite was detected in the HFS group compared to the non-HFS group.
PMC6521063	D00033	Particularly, LysoPC(16:0) was positively associated with NRI scores.
PMC6521063	D00034	In a mass spectrometry-based study, plasma LysoPC(16:0) was more significantly decreased in lung cancer patients than in healthy controls.
PMC6521063	D00035	In particular, low levels of LysoPC(16:0) in cancer tissues were suggested to be a biomarker associated with recurrence in prostate cancer patients.
PMC6521063	D00036	Oral high fat supplementation-induced upregulation of LysoPC metabolites, including LysoPC(16:0), might have yielded beneficial health effects in postoperative pancreatic cancer patients.
PMC6521063	D00037	On the contrary, high LysoPC(16:0) levels were reported to be an ovarian cancer biomarker.
PMC6521063	D00039	Another metabolite associated with both oral fat intake and NRI score was SM(d18:0/24:1).
PMC6521063	D00041	The same SM(d18:0/24:1) metabolite was downregulated in pancreatic cancer patients.
PMC6521063	D00043	The upregulation of SM(d18:0/24:1) by oral high fat supplementation might have contributed to the overall health benefits of the HFS in postoperative pancreatic cancer patients, but further studies are warranted to confirm this finding.

PMC6572825	D00018	We found that an increase in the abundance of certain vicinal (1,2)-diols, including non-esterified 9,10-DiHOME, 12,13-DiHOME, and esterified 19,20-DiHDoPE, were among the strongest discriminators of a pro-inflammatory response to postprandial TGRL.
PMC6572825	D00021	For example, 11,12-EpETrE reduced TNFɑ-induced VCAM-1 surface expression in HAEC.
PMC6572825	M01007	The extent of oxidation in the samples was monitored by tracking concentrations of 9-HETE, total TriHOME and F2-isoprostanes, which did not differ significantly between experimental groups.
PMC6572825	R02009	In the esterified PUFA categories, there was significant postprandial reduction in abundance of several n-3 PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and in n-6 PUFA, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA).
PMC6572825	R02011	Specifically, 12,13-dihydroxy octadecaenoic acid (12,13-DiHOME), 9,10-dihydroxy octadecaenoic acid (9,10-DiHOME), and 15,16-dihydroxy octadecadienoic acid (15,16-DiHODE) postprandially increased in abundance in both the esterified and non-esterified pools.
PMC6572825	R03008	Specifically, 9,10-DiHOME, 14,15-dihydroxy eicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DiHETrE), and 19,20-DiHDoPE contributed maximally to the discrimination of pro- and anti-atherogenic subjects in the analysis (Fig. ).

PMC6572825	R03023	In contrast, esterified diols derived from C18-PUFA LA and ALA (cluster 4), represented by 15,16-DiHODE, were enriched to a greater extent postprandially in anti-atherogenic TGRL.
PMC6572825	R05005	The strongest positive correlator with the measured ex vivo VCAM-1 surface expression was Cluster 1, which consisted predominantly of EPA and esterified EPA-derived metabolites (17,18-EpETE, 9-HEPE, 15-HEPE, 5-HEPE).

PMC6572825	R07003	The linoleic acid metabolites 9-HODE and 12,13-DiHOME, which were present in relatively high abundance in TGRL and had a strong negative influence on the modeled VCAM-1 expression, exhibited a dose-dependent effect in reducing HAEC VCAM-1 expression (Fig. ).
PMC6572825	R07006	9-HODE and 12,13-DiHOME reduce VCAM-1 surface expression in TNFα-stimulated HAEC.
PMC6572825	R07008	9-HODE and 12,13-DiHOME reduced VCAM-1 surface expression, whereas 19, 20-DiHDoPE did not alter VCAM-1 surface expression relative to TNFα.

PMC6592169	R04001	In the H group, the abundant metabolites were mainly sugars (maltose, fructose), sugar alcohols, amines (galactosamine) and a large set of organic and fatty acids (glycerol, octadecanoic acid, hexanedioic acid, benezenepropanoic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid).
PMC6592169	R04008	For instance, 17 metabolites that potentially participate in Asp metabolism, ammonia recycling, protein biosynthesis, and Trp metabolism, which supports the environment needed for tumorigenesis (Figure B), were only quantified in the CRC group, i.e., Lys, heptanedioic acid (a precursor of Lys), norvaline, and several amino acid and organic acid derivatives (Supplementary Table ).
PMC6592169	R05003	Specifically, higher abundances of sugars and sugar alcohols, such as fructose, iditol, sedoheptulose, maltose, glycerol, galactosamine, and fatty acids, such as 9, 12-octadecanoic acid, oleic acid, hexanedioic acid, and pentanedioic acid, were observed in the H group.

PMC6611759	R01020	b shows a relatively constant behavior across all exhalations (akin to CO_2 ), 2-dodecenal drops over time during consecutive exhalations and the decay is even more pronounced for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, whose signal intensity decays by ~ 35% during the first three exhalations, to then reach a steady state.
PMC6611759	R01024	For example, signal intensity drops between the first and the sixth exhalation for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal is around 50%, for 2-dodecenal the drop is around 30%, whereas for 4-hydroxy-2,6-pentadecadienal signal intensity remains stable (or even increases after the first exhalation).
PMC6611759	R02006	For example, the predicted λ _b:a  for 2-hexenal was 111, therefore exchanges almost exclusively in the airways.
PMC6611759	R02007	In contrast, 2-undecenal has a predicted λ _b:a  = 39; hence, it exchanges partially in the airways and in the alveoli.

PMC6617423	D00006	Five metabolites, namely PC (15:0/16:0), PG (12:0/13:0), LacCer (d18:1/16:0), D-Maltose, and PA, were identified as potential biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring prognosis of patients with CSCC, as their combined AUCs were sufficient to distinguish the subjects among the 3 groups.
PMC6617423	D00010	The main biological functions of PC (15:0/16:0) include storing energy, protecting the liver, increasing high-density lipoprotein levels, and restoring vascular elasticity.
PMC6617423	D00014	In this study, the level of PC (15:0/16:0) was highest in the GP group, followed by BT and PP.
PMC6617423	D00017	We found that the level of PG (12:0/13:0) was highest in the BT group, followed by PP and GP.
PMC6617423	D00021	In this study, the LacCer (d18:1/16:0) level was highest in the BT group, followed by GP and being lowest in PP.
PMC6617423	D00025	However, the reason why LacCer (d18:1/16:0) level does not increase in patients with recurrence remains to be elucidated.
PMC6617423	R05006	The levels of PA, D-Maltose, and PG (12:0/13:0) were highest in BT group, followed by PP group, and finally GP group.

PMC6629294	A02002	We also found that higher concentrations of 2 distinct SMs were associated with a higher risk of T2DM (HR 1.45 with 95% CI 1.18–1.78 for SM d16:1/18:0 and HR 1.40 with 95% CI 1.17–1.68 for SM d18:1/18:0).
PMC6629294	D00055	Neither of the recent studies evaluated longitudinal diabetes incidence data; however, Huynh et al. demonstrated a significant correlation between 1 of our putative prognostic markers, SM d18:1/18:0, and fasting glucose.
PMC6629294	D00057	Interestingly, Lemaitre et al. reported a complex relationship between several SMs (including SM d18:1/18:0) and insulin sensitivity that was dependent upon BMI.
PMC6629294	D00061	Furthermore, our survival analysis found that 2 SPs (SM d16:1/18:0 and SM d18:1/18:0) were significantly associated with diabetes occurrence, independent of age, sex, plasma lipid profile, and BMI, with HRs of about 1.4, suggesting that these SPs may be used as potential novel predictors for the development of diabetes.
PMC6629294	R00002	A notable exception involved the C16 ceramides (Cer d18:1/16:0 and Cer d18:2/16:0), which did not cluster with the other ceramides.
PMC6629294	R00059	Only 4 SPs, SM d16:1/18:0 and SM d18:1/18:0 and their metabolic precursors, Cer d16:1/18:0 and Cer d18:1/18:0, remained significant after adjustment for BMI, and when HbA1c was added to the model, only the 2 SMs remained independently associated with T2DM incidence.
PMC6629294	R00060	A net reclassification index (NRI) analysis demonstrated that the addition of SM d16:1/18:0 and SM d18:1/18:0 to the current clinical standard of HbA1c or HbA1c plus BMI provides moderately improved accuracy of the prediction of diabetes incidence for 38%–40% of individuals.
PMC6629294	R00063	Similar results were obtained when evaluating the effect of adding SM d16:1/18:0 and SM d18:1/18:0 to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities predictive model for diabetes risk (ref. and ).
PMC6629294	R00064	Interestingly, the improvements of these models were entirely due to SM d16:1/18:0, while SM d18:1/18:0 alone did not alter the models beyond a 95% CI.
PMC6629294	R00065	It is also of note that although the addition of SM d16:1/18:0 did improve the prediction of future diabetes risk for a relatively large proportion of the population, the magnitude of change of the predicted probability was modest and, as a consequence, may not have a large effect at the population level despite the improvement in prediction.

PMC6930386	A02001	Regardless of whether traditional clinical plasma lipid levels were normal or abnormal, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of five lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) species (LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) in the obese group compared with the normal-weight group (difference = −31.29% to −13.19%; P =9.91 × 10_−5  to 2.28 × 10_−2 ).
PMC6930386	D00003	In the present study, we observed significantly decreased concentrations of unsaturated LPC, LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0 in obese adolescents, which were not affected by traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	D00007	Significantly decreased levels of LPC18:1 and LPC18:2 have been observed in obese children.
PMC6930386	D00011	Rauschert et al. reported negative correlations between LPC18:1 and LPC18:2 with waist circumference that were independent of the LDL-C and HDL-C levels.
PMC6930386	D00012	Wang et al. also observed lower concentrations of unsaturated LPC, LPC18:1, and LPC18:2 in overweight/obese adults than in nonobese adults.

PMC6930386	D00014	Tulipani et al. concluded that plasma concentrations of LPC17:0, LPC18:1, and LPC18:2 show inverse correlations with BMI, body weight, and waist and hip circumference in morbidly obese subjects [, ].
PMC6930386	D00015	Notably, decreased plasma concentrations of LPC18:1 and LPC18:2 have been detected in both subjects with metabolically unhealthy obesity and metabolically healthy obesity.
PMC6930386	D00016	In addition, lower total LPC, LPC18:0, LPC18:2, and LPC20:4 levels were measured in obese and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes than in nonobese adults.
PMC6930386	D00021	A monozygotic twin study observed correlations between BMI and increased levels of LPC16:0 and LPC18:0 that were independent of genetic factors.
PMC6930386	D00022	The authors identified higher levels of LPC14:0 and LPC18:0 and a lower concentration of LPC18:1 in obese subjects compared with lean subjects.
PMC6930386	D00024	Based on this pattern, a higher LPC 16:1 level was detected in the obese group, while higher levels of other LPC species were observed in nonobese subjects.
PMC6930386	D00025	The present study extended the results from previous studies by revealing significant reductions in the levels of the unsaturated LPC subclass and five LPC species (LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) in obese adolescents that were independent of changes in traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	M01005	These cutoff values were chosen based on the cholesterol levels in children and adolescents developed by the expert panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP).
PMC6930386	R02004	Inverse correlations between LPC18:1, LPC18:2, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0 and obesity were identified in groups with different traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	R02007	Additionally, in the obese group, an elevated phosphatidylcholine 32:0 (PC32:0) level (difference = 20.87%; P =4.40 × 10_−3 ) was observed in adolescents with traditional abnormal clinical plasma lipid levels and decreased PC32:0 levels (difference = −16.32%; P =4.91 × 10_−4 ) were observed in adolescents with traditional normal clinical plasma lipid levels in our study.
PMC6930386	R03001	Five lipid species (LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) met this criterion, as shown in .

PMC6934557	R04022	We highlight that none of the markers identified in this study have previously been related to CRC with the exception of LPC (18:1).
PMC6934557	R04023	Interestingly, a significant decrease in LPC (18:1) was observed in non-advanced CRC patients but an increase in our patients with metastatic CRC, suggesting that this metabolite may potentially be useful as a biomarker of the progression of this disease.
PMC6935851	M03003	800 μl of methanol, 100 μl of distilled water and 10 μl of “heptadecanoic acid in methanol” (1 mg heptadecanoic acid in 1 ml methanol) were added and mixed.

PMC6938899	D01006	Nine phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were associated with obesity – all showing inverse associations, with the exception of PC (38:3), which showed a positive association with obesity (β = 0.36, P  = 1.7E-06; ).
PMC6938899	D01007	This association replicated in the ERF, and prior work has shown PC (38:3) to be positively associated with CVD and enriched in atherosclerotic plaques .
PMC6938899	D01008	Of the nine PCs associated with obesity, seven were available for replication and five (71%), including PC (38:3), replicated (Supplementary Table 2).
PMC6938899	D01017	Therefore, in conjunction with recent epidemiological evidence associating dairy consumption with changes in circulating LPC 17:0 , an abundance of genetic, epidemiologic, functional, and biochemical data implicating LPCs in CVD suggest that mechanistically understanding the enzyme kinetics and complexities of LPC metabolism may highlight promising therapeutic targets.
PMC6938899	D02001	The two dhSMs positively associated with obesity – SM 36:0 and SM (d18:0/24:0) – were also positively associated with dysglycemia, along with Cer (d18:0/24:0).
PMC6938899	D02002	Cer (d18:0/24:0) shares the same sphingosine backbone and fatty acyl side chains as SM (d18:0/24:0) such that the two are inter-convertible via the enzymatic actions of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS; Cer→SM) and sphingomyelinase (SMase; SM→Cer).
PMC6938899	D02003	Of note, SM 36:0 and SM (d18:0/24:0) were also associated with longitudinal change in glucose.
PMC6938899	M01003	All definitions were obtained from the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III report .
PMC6938899	R04003	LPC 18:1 and PC 36:2 were inversely associated with change in glucose, and SM 36:0 and SM (d18:0/24:0) were directly associated with change in glucose.
PMC6938899	R04005	SM (d18:2/24:1), which was inversely associated with dyslipidemia in cross-sectional analysis, was directly associated with longitudinal change in HDL-C. Single marker associations with longitudinal changes in metabolic risk factors.
PMC6938899	R04010	SM 36:0 and DAG 36:2 were retained in the final glucose model, together accounting for 6.1% of the variation in change in glucose (baseline glucose explained 22.1%).
PMC6938899	R04011	The HDL-C model contained SM (d18:2/24:1), LPC 20:3, and PS 36:0.
PMC6938899	R04013	LPC 18:3, SM (d18:1/16:0), and Cer (d18:1/24:1) were retained in the final TAG model.
PMC6948762	D00029	This finding is aligned with earlier studies that illuminated salutary effects of longer unsaturated FFAs, such as oleate and eicosapentaenoic acid, on inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and eventually better podocyte and pancreatic cell survival compared with the effect of saturated FFA palmitate (–).
PMC6948762	M01002	We retrieved 10 μL of serum and added water/methanol/dichloromethane at room temperature with 2:2:2 volume ratio, followed by spiking internal standards PC 17:0/17:0, LPC 17:0, PG 17:0/17:0, PE 17:0/17:0, TAG 17:0/17:0/17:0, SM 18:1/17:0, MAG 17:0, DAG 16:0/18:1, CE 17:0, ceramide phosphate 18:1/17:0, PA 17:0, PI 17:0/20:4, and PS 17:0/17:0.

PMC6962155	D00044	We believe that the higher concentration of PS (22:0/0:0) observed in the study is correlated with higher metastasis and death rate of TNBC patients.
PMC6962155	R05005	These metabolites are dUMP, L-octanoylcarnitine, L-proline, lysoPC (22:1), PS (22:0/0:0), and uric acid (Table ).

PMC6992008	D00050	Increased levels of PC (16:0/16:1) have been found in tumor tissue of CRC.
PMC6992008	D00051	Here, we have also observed increased PC with MW 731.7 (which corresponds to PC 16:0/16:1).
PMC6992008	D00052	Using a similar analytical technique, MALDI imaging mass spectrometry, Mirnezami et al. have reported elevated levels of PC 16:0/18:1 in colon tumor samples; however, this particular PC was not among the most altered PL species in our samples.
PMC6992008	D00056	This is of interest, as several PE species, such as PE (38:6) or PE (40:4), have been reported to be up-regulated in CRC tissues as compared to normal tissues.

PMC6993102	D00024	LTB4, the precursor of the other biomarker involved with AA pathways in this study, is a potent lipid mediator capable of promoting chemotaxis, neutrophil degranulation, and release of enzymes and ROS.
PMC6993102	D00025	LTB4 has a receptor with high specificity, B leukotriene receptor 1 (BLT1), expressed exclusively in inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils.
PMC6993102	D00026	In vivo , LTB4 is rapidly metabolized by different pathways in an attempt to decrease the inflammatory effects caused by this mediator.
PMC6993102	D00027	From neutrophil action, and with the participation of ω-hydroxylase, LTB4 is oxidized to 20-carboxy LTB4.
PMC6993102	D00028	The oxidized products of LTB4 were believed to be inactive species, but binding studies demonstrated that 20-carboxy LTB4 has the ability to bind to LTB1 and had the same chemotactic effects, suggesting a similar action of this molecule on inflammation (Wang et al., ;
PMC7007789	A02002	Mediation analysis revealed that the lipids LysoPC(P-15:0), PC(P-34:4), and PC(38:6) may mediate the effects of ascites on recurrence.
PMC7007789	A03000	Our findings suggest that LysoPC(P-15:0), PC(P-34:4), and PC(38:6) mediate the effect of ascites on the prognosis of patients with EOC.
PMC7007789	A03001	We believe therefore that it is reasonable to consider metabolic interventions targeting the metabolism of LysoPC(P-15:0), PC(P-34:4), and PC(38:6) as a palliative treatment for patients with EOC with ascites.
PMC7007789	D00008	Mediation analysis shows that LPC15:0 mediated the relationship between ascites and recurrence of EOC.
PMC7007789	D00010	Mediation analysis shows further that LysoPC(P-15:0), PC(P-34:4), and PC(38:6) mediated the relationship between ascites and prognosis.
PMC7007789	D00014	We believe it is reasonable to consider the use of interventions targeting the metabolism of LysoPC(P-15:0), PC(P-34:4), and PC(38:6) as a palliative treatment for patients with ascites.
PMC7007789	R03003	The data for LysoPC(P-15:0) serve as an example that explains the results.
PMC7007789	R03004	The risk ratio of ascites upon recurrence TE was 2.04; the effect of ascites on survival was significantly mediated through LysoPC(P-15:0); and IE was 1.32, accounting for 39.5% of TE.
PMC7007789	R03005	The risk ratio of ascites on recurrence DE, without considering LysoPC(P-15:0), was 1.54.
PMC7015966	D00028	TG (48:2) which was detected in 19/24 samples out of which ten were in the second batch, was on the other hand detected in the first and immediately repeated injections, but not detected after prolonged storage.
PMC7015966	R03003	Four amino acids were significantly affected by age (lysine, phenylalanie, valine and xleucine), 14 metabolites by batch assignments (AC (2:0), AC (4:0-DC), AC (14:1), citrulline, glycine, methionine, ADMA, kynurenine, PC-O (31:1), PC-O (34:0), PC-O (36:2), SM (34:1), CE (18:1) and CE (18:2)), and four metabolites (glycine, ADMA, PC-O (34:0) and hexose) were elevated in SPMS patients compared to controls (Fig.

PMC7020929	R00011	We further examined MS_2 CID of the bicarbonate anion adduct of PC 18:1/16:0 (m /z 820, CE = 30 eV, ), the sn -isomer of PC 16:0/18:1.
PMC7020929	R00015	Using the fragment peak at m /z 419 derived from PC 16:0/18:1 as an example, MS_3 CID of this peak produced sn -1 fatty acyl anions at m /z 255 (C16:0), suggesting that the sn -1 chain is preserved in the fragment ( and possible fragmentation pathways are shown in Scheme S1_† ).
PMC7020929	R00022	We performed MS_3 CID of all major fragments within the m /z range 600–800 formed from MS_2 CID of the bicarbonate adduct of PC 16:0/18:1.
PMC7020929	R00041	Although ions at m /z 445 and m /z 419 were each detected at low abundances in CID of PC 16:0/18:1 and PC 18:1/16:0, they were later proved to be the “sn -1 fragments” resulting from corresponding sn -isomers, which are present as minor impurities in the supplied samples.
PMC7020929	R01003	, For instance, the sn -purity of the PC 16:0/18:1 sample is 93 ± 2%, meaning that it contains 7 ± 2% PC 18:1/16:0.
PMC7020929	R01004	This measurement also explains the detection of a low abundance peak at m /z 445 from the PC 16:0/18:1 sample, which is actually the sn -1 fragment derived from PC 18:1/16:0.
PMC7020929	R01005	The same discussion applies for a small peak at m /z 419 from the PC 18:1/16:0 sample, which contains 13 ± 2% sn -isomers.
PMC7020929	R01007	shows data acquired from the 2 : 1 mixture of PC 16:0/18:1 and PC 18:1/16:0 (total concentration kept at 10 μM).
PMC7020929	R01008	The relative ion abundance of the sn -1 fragment of PC 18:1/16:0 (m /z 445) was normalized to the sum of sn -1 fragments of both isomers and plotted against corresponding concentrations (% mol).
PMC7020929	R02002	The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 10 pM from 121 Da NLS of the bicarbonate adduct of PC 16:0/18:1, based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 3 (Fig. S9a_† ).
PMC7020929	R02003	Although this LOD was about 5 times higher than that obtained from PIS m /z 184 (phosphocholine head group ion) of protonated PC 16:0/18:1 (Fig. S9b_† ), it was significantly more sensitive than the use of formate or acetate anion adduct ions (Fig. S9c_† ).
PMC7020929	R02005	compares calibration curves resulting from 121 Da NLS for PC 16:0/18:1 and PC 18:1/16:0 with PC 15:0/15:0 used as the internal standard (IS, 0.5 μM).
PMC7020929	R02011	We also noticed that the identity of the fatty acyl chains in PCs, i.e. length or degrees of unsaturation, had an impact on ion response in 121 Da NLS (spectrum of an equimolar mixture of PC 15:0/15:0, PC 16:0/18:0, and PC 18:0/20:4 is shown in Fig.
PMC7020929	R03005	Using PC 18:1/16:0 as a model compound (10 μM, 50/50, v/v, acetone/H_2 O with 5 mM NH_4 HCO_3 ), the solution was subjected to offline PB reaction and collected for nanoESI in negative ion mode (experimental details are provided in the ESI_† ).
PMC7020929	R04020	Taking PC 30:0 ([PC + HCO_3 ]_– , m /z 766) as an example, albeit at relatively low ion abundance (0.5%, normalized to PC 36:2, the most abundant PC in the bovine liver extract), HILIC-MS_2 CID produced high quality data for structural characterization.
PMC7020929	R04021	In the m /z region of sn -1 fragment ions, detection of ions at m /z 391 (sn -1 14:0), m /z 405 (sn -1 15:0), and m /z 419 (sn -1 16:0) proved that PC 30:0 contained three molecular species: PC 14:0/16:0, PC 16:0/14:0, and PC 15:0/15:0.
PMC7020929	R04024	Using PC 34:1 as an example, MS_2 CID of [M + HCO_3 ]_– (m /z 820) suggested that it contained 94% PC 16:0/18:1 and 6% PC 18:1/16:0.
PMC7020929	R04025	By applying the quantitation procedure described earlier, PC 16:0/18:1 was determined to be 1.7 ± 0.1
PMC7020929	R04026	ng/(0.4 μg extract), while PC 18:1/16:0 was 0.1 ng/(0.4
PMC7020929	R04028	Given that PC 16:0/18:1 was the dominant component (94%), HILIC-PB-MS_2 CID in positive ion mode readily provided CC location information, viz.
PMC7020929	R04031	The zoomed-in region in shows two pairs of CC diagnostic ions (m /z 171, 197; m /z 199, 225) of C18:1, suggesting that PC 18:1/16:0 contains two CC isomers, PC 18:1(Δ9)/16:0 and PC 18:1(Δ11)/16:0.
PMC7020929	R04032	Combining all the above information, it is evident that PC 16:0_18:1 contains four distinct molecular species, including two sn -isomers and two CC location isomers of the C18:1.
PMC7020929	R04038	Although it has been suggested that the sn -2 position is preferred by polyunsaturated acyl chains,, our data quantitatively show that many of them still consist of minor sn -isomers, such as PC 20:4/16:0 (4%) and PC 22:4/18:0 (9%).
PMC7020929	R05006	Among these, only PC 32:1 and PC 34:2 showed significant changes in relative ion abundances (IS: PC 15:0/15:0).
PMC7020929	R05011	These include PC 16:0_18:1, PC 16:0_16:1 (data are provided in Fig.
PMC7020929	R05012	S14b_† ), PC 15:0_18:1, PC 16:0_17:1, and PC 16:0_17:0.
PMC7020929	R05013	For instance, PC 16:0_17:0 was found to exhibit significant changes in sn -ratios
PMC7020929	R05014	(P = 4.6 × 10_–7 ), accompanied by a large increase of PC 16:0/17:0 (65%) in cancerous tissue relative to control (15%).
PMC7020929	R05016	Moreover, because PC 16:0_17:0 is a saturated lipid, it cannot be analyzed for CC location isomers.
PMC7020929	R05017	A more challenging example is given by PC 33:1.
PMC7020929	R05018	Beam-type CID revealed that it contained two fatty acyl compositional isomers: PC 16:0_17:1 (major) and PC 15:0_18:1 (minor).
PMC7020929	R05019	The compositional changes of the C18:1 Δ9 and Δ11 isomers of PC 15:0_18:1 were not statistically different between the normal and cancerous tissue samples.
PMC7020929	R05020	In contrast, sn -position analysis revealed that both PC 16:0_17:1 and PC 15:0_18:1 contained sn -isomers and each pair of isomers showed significant changes between cancerous and normal breast tissues.
PMC7020929	R05022	PC 16:0_18:1 was one of the most abundant species in breast tissue and it was identified to consist of sn -isomers and CC location isomers (Δ9 vs. Δ11 in C18:1).
PMC7020929	R05023	Relative to the control, the major sn -isomer PC 16:0/18:1 and the CC location isomer C18:1(Δ9) were found to increase significantly in the cancerous tissue samples (P = 3.5 × 10_–7 and P = 2 × 10_–4 , respectively, ).
PMC7020929	R05025	, Our data clearly suggest that PC 16:0_18:1 may contain four structural isomers from combinations of two sn -isomers and two CC location isomers of the C18:1.
PMC7020929	R05027	Pham et al. demonstrated monitoring of relative compositions of the same four isomers of PC 16:0_18:1 individually from MS/MS experiments containing different sequences of OzID and CID.

PMC7047385	R00011	Cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol also showed a negative correlation to Phe; however, this was not statistically significant.
PMC7058291	R00003	The mean values of most traits fell within the normal range, with the exception of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (121 mg/dL), which was higher than the level recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program of the United States (< 100 mg/dL).
PMC7118041	R01012	This class ionize highly efficiently in positive mode but the corresponding MS2 spectra by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) only delivers head group-specific fragments that cannot help to identify the fatty acyl chain composition (compare lipid species level (e.g., PC 32:1) and molecular species level (e.g., PC 16:0_16:1)).
PMC7118041	R01027	The white bar corresponds to the lipids identified in both fractionated and non-fractionated full extract, but the level of identification was improved in the fractionated yeast (molecular species level, e.g., PC 16:0_16:1 instead of lipid species level, e.g., PC 32:1).
PMC7118049	M03003	An amount of 50 μL of the internal standard solution (containing 0.54 nmol TG 57:0, 0.59 nmol TG 51:0, and 0.73 nmol DG 40:0) was added to a sample volume of 100 μL (2 mg dw/mL) fecal homogenate prior to lipid extraction and extracted according to the protocol of Bligh and Dyer with a total chloroform volume of 2 mL and an extraction time of 60 min at room temperature.
PMC7118049	R00008	None of the analyzed samples contained signals representing a relevant interference with the selected internal standards (IS) DG 40:0, TG 51:0, and TG 57:0 (ESM Fig.
PMC7118049	R00013	Highest mean concentrations were detected for polyunsaturated species with more than two double bonds: DG 36:3, DG 36:4, TG 54:3, TG 54:4, and TG 54:5.
PMC7118049	R00015	For DG, also species containing FA 12:0 and 14:0 were detected precluding application of DG 28:0 as IS.
PMC7118049	R03004	DG 36:6, DG 38:0, TG 54:2, and TG 54:1 were spiked at six different concentrations (ESM Fig.
PMC7118049	R03010	Low (DG 32:0, TG 48:0), medium (DG 34:2, TG 52:2), and high (DG 36:3, TG 54:4) abundant species showed a good correlation of expected and measured concentrations (ESM Fig.
PMC7118049	R03012	The assay was linear at low (DG 32:0 and TG 48:0) and high concentrations (DG 36:3, TG 54:4) and matched the above described LoQ and LoD and linear range (up to 250 mg DG dw/mL and 150 mg TG dw/mL), respectively.
PMC7122646	A03002	In UPLC-MS analyses, lysophos-phatidylethanolamine (lysoPE)(18:0) and lysophosphatidic acid(20:0) were higher in serum, and phosphatidylcholines (PC) (16:1/18:2, 20:3/18:0, O-20:0/22:4), lysoPC(16:0), PE(O-18:2/20:4), sphingomyelin(18:0/22:0), and linoleic acid were lower.
PMC7122646	A03004	By UPLC-MS, PE(18:0/18:2) and PC(P-16:0/20:4) were higher in PRP compared with PFP samples.
PMC7122646	D00021	We observed higher PC(16:1/18:2, 20:3/18:0, and O-20:0/22:4) and lysoPC(16:0) in plasma using RP (ESI+) or HILIC UPLC-MS (ESI+).
PMC7122646	D00023	Our RP UPLC-MS (ESI−) results showed that lysoPE(18:0) and lysoPA(20:0) were higher in serum which is more consistent with studies that used fasting samples (; ; ).
PMC7122646	D00030	By UPLC-MS, we identified 2 metabolites (with an LoA ≤ 3) that were higher in PRP compared with PFP samples: PE(18:0/18:2) and PC(P-16:0/20:4).
PMC7122646	R01011	LysoPE(18:0) and lysophosphatidic acid (lysoPA)(20:0) were higher in serum than plasma.
PMC7122646	R02004	In the RP UPLC-MS analysis, PE(18:0/18:2) and PC(P-16:0/20:4) were higher in PRP than PFP.
PMC7122646	R03005	For the UPLC-MS measurements, run in triplicate, we calculated analytical variation (CVa); the range was 1.8% (PC(P-16:0/20:4)) to 60.5% (lysoPE(18:0)).
PMC7122646	R03006	For the metabolites, lysoPC(16:0), PC(P-16:0/20:4), linoleic acid, and linoleyl carnitine, the analytical variation values were less than half of the individual variation values (CVa < 1/2 CVi) indicating adequate precision.
