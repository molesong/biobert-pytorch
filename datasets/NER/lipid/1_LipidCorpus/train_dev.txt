Although O
little O
is O
known O
regarding O
the O
action O
of O
nonanoic B-lipid
acid I-lipid
in O
humans, O
nonanoic B-lipid
acid I-lipid
is O
a O
family O
of O
medium-chain O
fatty O
acids O
including O
valproic O
acid, O
which O
is O
used O
to O
treat O
manic O

in O
patients O
with O
bipolar O

and O
schizophrenia. O

To O
determine O
whether O
20-HETE B-lipid
can O
activate O
small O
GTPase O
Ras, O
HRPTEC O

were O
treated O
with O

In O
conclusion, O
