Using O

we O

increased O

acid O
(LPA O

where O
it O
correlated O
with O

There O
were O
six O
main O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
in O
relation O
to O
HCC O
versus O
controls, O
(1) O
that O
two O
bile O

and O
two O
fetal O
bile O

were O
elevated, O
(2) O
that O
bilirubin O
and O

were O
elevated, O
(3) O
that O
11 O
lysophospholipids O
were O
attenuated, O
(4) O
that O
two O
very O
long-chain O
fatty O
acids O
were O
attenuated, O
(5) O
that O
LPA B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
was O
considerably O
elevated O
in O
4/20 O
HCC O
patients, O
and O
(6) O
that O

the O
HCC O
group O
as O
a O
whole O
LPA O

was O
strongly O
correlated O
with O

As O

this O
interpretation O
is O
supported O
by O
the O
work O

whereby O

We O
further, O

the O

In O

the O

Although O

two O

Interestingly, O

Finally, O
a O

was O
also O
described. O

Low O

arose O
as O
a O

Moreover, O
high O

are O

with O

by O

it O

and O
also O
produces O

when O

All O
these O
results O
could O
pinpoint O
a O
beneficial O
effect O
of O
reduced O
LPC B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
levels O
that O
argue O
against O
our O
claim O
that O
it O
marks O
an O

risk, O
but O
although O
high O
levels O
of O

are O
correlated O
with O
high O
plasma O
and O
plaque O
levels O
of O

LPC O
16:0 O

are O
not. O

It O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
plasma O
LPC B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
can O
inhibit O
Lp-PLA2 O
activity O
both O
in O

and O
in O
vivo, O
thereby O
suppressing O
their O
neuroinflammative O
properties. O

Apart O
from O
suppressing O
Lp-PLA2 O
activity, O
plasmatic O
LPC B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
is O
neuroprotective O
on O
brain O
ischemia O
models, O
mainly O
through O
activation O
of O
TREK-1 O
potassium O
channels. O

Finally, O
it O
is O
known O
that O
LPC B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
is O
a O
potent O
inducer O
of O
superoxide O
ion O
production O
in O
endothelial O
cells O
and O
controlled O
levels O
of O
superoxide O
serve O
as O
angiogenic O
factors O
in O
ischemic O
angiogenesis. O

Due O
to O
all O
these O
neuroprotective O
properties, O
decreased O
plasma O
levels O
of O
LPC B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
could O
contribute O
to O
an O
early O
SR O
risk. O

Nonetheless, O
when O
we O
evaluated O
potential O
risk O
models O
accounting O
LPC B-lipid
16:0, I-lipid
it O
did O
not O
add O
a O
significant O
value O
over O
the O
clinical O
parameters O
explained O
by O
ABCD2 O
and O
LAA O
presence. O

This O
fits O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
ABCD2 O
and O
LAA O
are O
closely O
related O
to O
pathophysiologic O
events O
previously O
invoked O
in O
the O
homeostasis O
of O
LPC B-lipid
16:0 I-lipid
(enumerated O
above). O

The O
potential O
implication O
of O
LysoPC O
metabolism O
in O
SR O
was O
further O
reinforced O
by O
the O
finding O
of O
LPC B-lipid
20:4 I-lipid
as O
a O
potential O
biomarker O
of O
SR O
based O
on O
ROC O
curves O
of O
aggregated O
cohorts. O

Interestingly, O
after O
the O
use O
of O
NRI, O
IDI, O
and O
Hosmer-Lemeshow O
test, O
the O
statistics O
indicated O
that O
LPC B-lipid
20:4 I-lipid
significantly O
improves O
prediction O
capacities O
of O
combined O

and O
LAA O
scores. O

Finally, O
we O
identified O
LPC B-lipid
22:6 I-lipid
as O
a O
potential O
LAA O
biomarker. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
know, O
no O
previous O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
role O
of O
LPC B-lipid
22:6 I-lipid
on O
carotid O

formation O
or O

but O
increased O
levels O

point O

Therefore, O

The O

However, O
because O

20:4;O I-lipid
are O
essential O
components O
of O
renal O

Either O

Increased O

The O

In O

can O
account O

In O

This O

but O
is O

Diminished O

augment O

In O

be O

that, O

the O

higher O

(p O

We O
also O

found O
that O

was O
the O

related O

to O

that O

could O
be O

Of O
all O

we O
found O
that O

had O
increased O

a O
clear O
relationship O
between O

levels O

To O
assess O
the O
clinical O
relevance O

levels, O
prospective O
studies O
are O
needed. O

FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
(20-HETE), O
an O
arachidonic O
metabolite, O
is O
a O
potent O
vasoactive O
cytochrome O
(CYP) O
eicosanoid O
and O
a O
key O
constituent O
of O
microcirculation. O

In O
agreement O
with O
us, O
some O
authors O
have O
already O
shown O
in O
humans O
that O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
was O
associated O
with O
hypertension O
and O
BMI O

In O
addition, O
Ward O
et O
al. O
suggested O
that O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
acute O
ischaemic O
stroke O
and O
subsequent O
clinical O
outcome. O

According O
with O
us, O
recent O
study O
also O
showed O
that O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
was O
associated O
with O
endothelial O
cell O
proinflammatory O
actions O
that O
promote O
atherosclerosis O
and O
vascular O
remodeling. O

Among O
the O
proinflammatory O
endothelial O
cell O
changes O
that O
occur O
in O
response O
to O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
are O
increased O
adhesion O
molecule O
expression O
and O
cytokine O
release. O

Alterations O
in O
levels O
of O
CYP O
enzymes, O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
or O
EETs O
contribute O
to O
endothelial O
dysfunction O
and O
cardiovascular O
diseases O
such O
as O
ischemic O
injury, O
hypertension O
and O
atherosclerosis O
[,]. O

Specifically, O
they O
analyzed O
FA B-lipid

total O
epoxyeicosatrienoic O

(EET) O
and O
dihydroxyeicotatriennoic O
acids O
(DiHETEs) O
in O
396 O
patients O
with O
ischemic O
stroke O
and O
carotid O
plaque. O

Patients O
with O
echolucent O
plaque O
showed O
significantly O
higher O
levels O
of O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
and O
DiHETEs O
but O
lower O
levels O
of O
EETs. O

Our O
findings O
described O
that O
among O
all O
metabolites O
of O
the O
platelet O
activation/aggregation O
pathway O
analysed O
in O
a O
group O
of O
men O
with O
unstable O
carotid O
plaque O
vs O
a O
healthy O
control O
group, O
the O
only O
metabolite O
which O
showed O
the O
highest O
and O
most O
significant O
levels O
is O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O. I-lipid

Therefore, O
we O
could O
not O
conclude O
that O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
was O
a O
potential O
factor O
related O
to O
plaque O
instability O
or O
atherosclerosis O
progression. O

Hence, O
it O
seems O
interesting O
to O
publish O
our O
results O
on O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
as O
a O
possible O

Unfortunately, O
even O
when O

the O

be O

For O
this O

Even O
though O

was O
more O

from O

The O

however, O
we O

Besides, O

22:6;O, I-lipid
yet, O
this O

is O

Given O
this, O
good O
quantitation O

would O
not O
be O
possible O
if O

Yet, O

the O

even O
more O

for O

~ 35% O
during O

For O

For O

the O

111, O
therefore O

In O
contrast, O

it O

This O

for O

In O

in O

The O

a O

that O

Furthermore, O

Interestingly, O
the O

entirely O

These O

therefore, O
FA B-lipid
20:4;O I-lipid
and O
leukotriene O

may O
play O
a O
key O
role O
on O

In O
the O

leukotriene O

were O
significantly O
lower O

the O

in O
the O

had O
a O
trend O

Thus, O
relatively O

be O
associated O
with O
low O
levels O
of O
FA B-lipid

Meanwhile, O
FA B-lipid

is O
also O
a O
metabolite O
processed O

FA B-lipid
